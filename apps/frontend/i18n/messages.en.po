Access is difficult. Retreat is tricky from the start. turning back rapidly becomes impossible. Options for retreat are few and difficult. In case of bad weather or any other problem, alpinists will have to rely on themselves only.<br /><br /><strong>VI</strong>: The route is long and may requires several days.

Good hiking boots. Average orientation capabilities. Basic experience in the mountains is advisable.<br /><br /><strong>T4</strong>: At times there is no path. Hands might be needed for overcoming certain difficulties. Terrain is somewhat exposed with delicate grassy slopes or slopes mixing rocks, easy nevés or glacier which are not snow covered (no crevasse danger).<br /><em>Requirements:</em> Familiarity with exposure. Rigid soled hiking boots. Ability to evaluate terrain and good orientation capabilities. Alpine experience is advisable. In case of bad weather, retreat could be complicated.<br /><br /><strong>T5</strong>: There is often no path and some easy climbing. Terrain is exposed and demanding with steep slopes and rocks. Glaciers and nevés increase the risk of slipping and falling.<br /><em>Requirements:</em> Mountaineering boots. Confident evaluation of terrain and very good orientation capabilities. A good experience of the high mountains and basic use of ice axe an rope are required.<br /><br /><strong>T6</strong>: Mostly no path (and no marking) and some climbing (up to French grade 2). Often very exposed with steep slopes and delicate rock sections. Steeper glaciers and nevés with increased risk.<br /><em>Requirements:</em> Excellent capabilities for orientation. Confirmed alpine experience and familiarity with the use of technical mountaineering equipment.<br /><br />See also help on the <a href=\"/articles/106859/en\">hiking grades</a>."
